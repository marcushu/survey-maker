# survey-maker

Survey Maker delivers the basics for designing surveys and collecting survey results.
Once the survey has been created, participants can be added. A unique url to a blank survey is generated
to be pasted in an email, etc.  The finished surveys are recorded, and results tallied.

Visit a running example [here](https://surveymaker-2ece7.web.app/).

Log in with sample user info:

    email: `john!@doe.com`
    
    password `johndoe`

#### note: 

This implementation displays results anonymously, but the back end does collect a name
to go with each survey, if desired.

The back end for the application can be found [here](https://github.com/marcushu/quickSURVEY-API).
